# Heron AI for AutoCAD

> **Dear Modelers - please do not install this yet.**
>
> This repository is public so the work is open, but it is not finished. The plug-in inside AutoCAD
> still has to pass its live checks ([NEEDS-CHECKING](docs/NEEDS-CHECKING.md)). I will announce it
> when it is ready to install.
>
> **Programmers and AI engineers: your thoughts are welcome.** Read the code and share suggestions
> or corrections through an Issue.

**Let a chat work in your AutoCAD - only when you connect it, and only as far as your padlocks allow.**

> The modeller focuses on the drawing. Heron does the AutoCAD work behind it.

Heron AI for AutoCAD is the AutoCAD member of the [Heron AI](https://github.com/Ajmalpshaik/Heron-AI)
family. Same name, same ribbon, same padlocks, same "Heron AI is changing your drawing" banner: a
modeller who knows Heron in Revit knows it here.

## What it is

You describe the work in plain language; Claude does it in the AutoCAD you already have open:

```
"Check the connection and tell me what's open."
"Draw a 5000 x 3000 rectangle at the origin on layer A-WALL, in red."
"Check this drawing against our layer standard."
"Make me a camera schedule from the CAM blocks."
"Put sheet E-101 on A1 with our title block, ground floor at 1:100."
"This IFC came in on IfcWall, IfcDuct... make it a shop drawing."
"My UCS is rotated 23 degrees - draw it square to that."
"Show me what you drew."
```

Geometry appears live, every change is **one undo step**, and nothing reaches AutoCAD until you
press **Heron** on the ribbon.

## What you see in AutoCAD

Ribbon tab **Heron**, panel **AI Bridge**:

| Button | Off (safe) | On |
|---|---|---|
| **Heron** | dark heron: no chat can see this AutoCAD | lit heron: a chat can reach it. The arrow opens **Bridge Status** |
| **Changes** | blue padlock: Heron can only read and look | red padlock: Heron may draw, modify and delete |
| **Publish** | Heron may not save or export | Heron may save, export, plot |
| **Admin** | no commands or AutoLISP | Heron may run commands, AutoLISP, system variables |
| **Ask to Keep** | changes are kept at once | after each change: **Keep it / Discard it** |

While Heron works, a small card at the top of AutoCAD says **"Heron AI is reading your drawing"**
(blue) or **"Heron AI is changing your drawing"** (amber), then **finished** (green) or **stopped**
(red). The command line keeps a line such as `Heron: Draw Line. Done in 0.4 s`.

Everything starts **off**. Turning a padlock on asks first; turning it off never asks. The same
switches are commands: `HERON`, `HERONSTATUS`, `HERONCHANGES`, `HERONPUBLISH`, `HERONADMIN`,
`HERONASKTOKEEP`. Full detail: [docs/06-heron-plugin.md](docs/06-heron-plugin.md).

## Parts

| Part | Responsibility | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| **Heron for AutoCAD** (C#) | The plug-in: ribbon, padlocks, banner, Keep or Discard, the secure pipe | [`autocad/`](autocad/README.md) |
| **Heron MCP for AutoCAD** (Python) | The MCP server: the `autocad_*` tools, done over COM, gated by the plug-in | [`src/autocad_mcp/`](src/autocad_mcp/README.md) |
| **Tools & tests** | Build and install the plug-in, smoke test, structure check, test suites | [`tools/`](tools/README.md), [`tests/`](tests/README.md) |

Documentation is in [`docs/`](docs/README.md); stopped experiments in [`archive/`](archive/README.md).
Drawings stay on the PC that made them; none are in this repository.

## What it can do

The live list is always `.venv\Scripts\autocad-mcp.exe --list-tools`. Every tool has a level, and
the level decides which padlock it needs:

| Level | Needs | What |
|---|---|---|
| Read | connected | status, list and find, measure, extents, selection, layers, blocks, styles, **the UCS**, **saved locations**, **preview image**, **standards check**, **attribute schedules** |
| View | connected | zoom, regen, switch / open / create drawing |
| Change | Changes | draw, text, dimensions, hatch, blocks, batch drawing, move ... array, modify, delete, layers, **the UCS**, **sheets, title blocks and viewports**, **drawing settings and styles**, **remap layers / tidy an import**, **several tools in one call** |
| Publish | Changes + Publish | save, export / plot to PDF (whole sheet, a window, or a saved location) |
| Admin | Changes + Admin | any command, AutoLISP, system variables, purge, audit |

Every tool with its options: [docs/03-tools-reference.md](docs/03-tools-reference.md).
Sheets, the UCS and turning an import into a shop drawing:
[docs/09-sheets-and-coordinates.md](docs/09-sheets-and-coordinates.md).

## What keeps your drawing safe

- **Invisible until connected.** AutoCAD starts disconnected every time. The pipe answers only your
  Windows user, and each connect makes a new session password.
- **Padlocks, off by default,** read fresh on every call. A broken settings file means all off.
- **One undo step per call.** Optional **Keep or Discard** after each change.
- **Wrong-drawing guard.** If you switch drawings mid-job, a change is refused until Heron looks again.
- **No double drawing.** If AutoCAD goes busy half-way through a change, Heron does not retry; it
  says "outcome unknown, read the drawing back first".
- **Every call audited** to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Heron\autocad\audit\`.

## Install (for testing only, see the banner above)

Needs Windows, **full AutoCAD 2021 to 2027** (not LT), Python 3.10+, and the .NET SDK to build.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/build_plugin.py
```

Close AutoCAD, then:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/install_plugin.py
```

Start AutoCAD, press **Heron**, and connect Claude Code (this folder's [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json) does it
when Claude Code opens here). Full steps: [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).
