"""Can the right tool actually be found, in a modeller's own words?

Ajmal's doubt, in his words: *"still, I have doubt that it will find
everything fast."* He was right to doubt it - the first version put the right
tool first on 36 of 55 phrases and missed six altogether. This file is how
that stopped being an opinion. It now stands at 66 of 80 first and 80 of 80
in the top three, over all 115 tools.

**These phrases are our own**, so the score is a floor on a sample, not a
promise about every phrase anyone will ever type. What it does catch is
regression: rename a tool, reword a "Use when" line, or add a tool that
steals a common word, and the number drops here before it costs anyone time
at the machine.

When a phrase misses, the fix is almost always the **tool's own `Use when`
line**, not the scoring. That is how `autocad_drawing_setup` came to say
DIMSCALE out loud: this test showed it did not.
