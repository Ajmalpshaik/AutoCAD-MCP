"""The COM link to a running AutoCAD.

AutoCAD's Automation interface is an out-of-process, single-threaded-apartment
COM server. Two consequences shape this module:

1. Every COM call must happen on one thread that has called CoInitialize.
   FastMCP tools run on asyncio's event loop, so all COM work is marshalled
   onto a single dedicated worker thread via ``run()``.

2. AutoCAD rejects calls while it is busy — a modal dialog is up, the user is
   mid-command, a regen is running. That is transient and must be retried, not
   reported as a failure.
