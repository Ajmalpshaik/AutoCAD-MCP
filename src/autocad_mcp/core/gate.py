"""The Heron gate every tool call passes through.

Order for one call:

1. Look at AutoCAD (which process, which drawing). Nothing is changed.
2. Wrong-drawing guard: a change to a drawing other than the one Heron last
   looked at (with autocad_status, or by switching) is refused.
3. Ask the plug-in to ``begin``: it checks connection, the chat's turn and
   the padlock this tool's level needs, raises the banner, and says whether
   it will ask Keep or Discard afterwards.
4. If it will ask, put an UNDO mark down first, so Discard can go back to
   exactly here: the job, the zoom to it, layers a batch made, all of it.
5. Run the tool.
6. If the call really wrote and the plug-in asks, Discard means UNDO Back to
   the mark, then check the new objects are gone before saying so.
7. ``end`` and the audit line, whatever happened, cancellation included.

Calls run one at a time (one banner, one COM worker). Pipe calls run off the
event loop, so a slow plug-in never stalls the server.
