"""The Python end of the Heron bridge to the plug-in inside AutoCAD.

The plug-in (autocad/Heron.AutoCAD.Bridge) owns whether AutoCAD is connected
and which padlocks are open. This module finds the plug-in serving the AutoCAD
we are attached to, and asks it before and after every tool call:

- The plug-in writes an address file per AutoCAD process when the user presses
  Heron, and deletes it on disconnect. No file means not connected.
- Each request is one JSON line over a current-user named pipe, carrying the
  session token from that file, and gets one JSON line back.

Every refusal ends with NOTHING_SENT, and that sentence is true: refusals are
raised before any COM work starts.
