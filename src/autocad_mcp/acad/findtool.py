"""Searching the toolbox in plain words.

A hundred tools are only useful if the right one surfaces from the words a
draftsman would actually say - "how many metres of pipe on this layer", not
"invoke the length aggregation tool". This scores every tool against a phrase
and puts the best first.

It is deliberately small and pure: no AutoCAD, no index, no third-party
search engine. Scoring a phrase against a hundred short documents is fast
enough that the whole catalogue is searched on every call, which means there
is no index to go stale.

The scoring is bag-of-words with three ideas:

* **Where a word appears matters.** A word in the tool's own name is worth
  more than the same word in its summary, which is worth more than one in a
  "Use when" line.
* **A rare word tells you more than a common one.** "flange" appears in one
  tool, "layer" in thirty, so matching "flange" should count far more. That
  is inverse document frequency, worked out from the catalogue itself.
* **"Don't use when" counts against.** A tool that names itself only to send
  you elsewhere should not win on that mention.
