"""Escape hatches: raw AutoCAD commands, AutoLISP evaluation, housekeeping.

The typed tools cover the common drafting operations. These cover everything
else — AutoCAD has hundreds of commands and a full LISP interpreter, and an
agent that can reach them is not limited to what this server anticipated.

The hazard is dialogs. A command that opens a modal dialog blocks AutoCAD's
COM interface until a human dismisses it, which hangs every later tool call.
Most such commands have a command-line form prefixed with a hyphen, and the
guards here steer callers to it.

    This is the escape hatch for anything the typed tools do not cover —

    The command runs as if the user typed it, so it needs every argument the
    interactive command would ask for, separated by \\n. A command left waiting
    for input will block every later tool call until someone presses Esc in
    AutoCAD.

    Prefer a typed tool when one exists: those validate their inputs, return
    the handles of what they made, and cannot leave AutoCAD mid-command.

    The command is wrapped in an undo mark so one call is one Ctrl+Z. UNDO,
    REDO, U, MREDO and OOPS are sent unwrapped, since running those inside an
    open undo group does not roll back reliably.
