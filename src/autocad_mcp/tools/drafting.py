    Automation has no call that makes a wipeout, so this types the WIPEOUT
    command with every corner in world coordinates and snaps off, then finds
    the object it made. One undo step.

    Args:
        points (Optional[list[list[float]]]): the outline's corners.
        boundary_handle (Optional[str]): or a closed straight-sided polyline.
        erase_boundary (bool): delete that polyline afterwards.
        frames (Optional[str]): 'hide', 'show' or 'show_no_plot', for the drawing.
        layer (Optional[str]): target layer, created if missing.
        color (Optional[str | int]): colour name or ACI number.

    Returns:
        str: JSON: {"created": true, "handle": str, "type": "wipeout",
             "layer": str, "corners": int, "boundary_erased": bool,
             "not_set": [str]}

    Examples:
        - Use when: "mask the hatch behind this tag" — the tag's box as points.
        - Use when: "turn this closed outline into a wipeout" — boundary_handle,
          erase_boundary=true.
        - Use when: "hide the wipeout frames" — frames='hide' (or
          'show_no_plot' to see them on screen only).
        - Don't use when: it is only a text background — autocad_add_label
          and MText have a background mask of their own.

    Error Handling:
        - Fewer than three corners, corners in a line, an open polyline or one
          with arcs are refused before anything is typed.
        - If AutoCAD is still asking when the command should be done, it is
          cancelled and the tool says so; nothing is left half made.
