"""3D modelling COM has no call for, done by the Heron plug-in (D-40).

Loft, rounding and bevelling solid edges, shelling, press-pull and thicken are
AutoCAD commands with no ActiveX method, so these tools ask the plug-in to do
them through AutoCAD's .NET API. Each runs in one transaction inside AutoCAD:
it all lands or none of it does, and a refusal says "Nothing was changed."

Edges and faces are picked by a plain word ('top', 'vertical') that goes by
the solid's box, or by the numbers ``autocad_list_solid_faces_and_edges``
gives. The numbers hold while the solid is unchanged: after any edit, list it
again.
