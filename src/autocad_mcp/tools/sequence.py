"""One call that runs several tools in order: AutoLISP's ``progn``, as a tool.

Setting up a sheet is five calls that only make sense together — make the
layout, set the page up, place the title block, cut the viewport, fill the
attributes. Sent one at a time they are five round trips, five chances for the
drawing to change underneath, and five places to stop half-finished.

``autocad_sequence`` takes the list. **Every step's arguments are checked
against that tool's own schema before the first one runs**, so a sequence that
cannot be completed changes nothing at all — the same rule
``autocad_batch_draw`` follows.

**It cannot raise what you are allowed to do.** The sequence itself is a
CHANGE tool, and it refuses any step whose level is Publish or Admin. So it can
draw, modify and delete exactly as the Changes padlock already allows, and it
can never save a file, run a command or evaluate AutoLISP on the way. There is
no recursion either: a sequence cannot contain a sequence.

Undo: each step keeps its own undo step, so Ctrl+Z backs them out one at a
time — which is what a drafter wants when step four of five was wrong. With the
**Ask to Keep** padlock on, Discard backs out the whole call at once.

    This is AutoLISP's ``progn``: the steps that only make sense together, sent
    together. A whole sheet in one call — layout, page setup, title block,
    viewport — or a whole import clean-up — remap the layers, tidy the
    overrides, flatten, check the standard.

    Every step's arguments are validated against that tool's own schema first,
    so a sequence with a mistake in step four changes nothing at all. Each step
    that runs keeps its own undo step; with the Ask to Keep padlock on, Discard
    backs out the whole call.

    It cannot do more than the Changes padlock already allows: steps at the
    Publish or Admin level, and a sequence inside a sequence, are refused
    before anything runs.

    Args:
        steps (list[dict]): the steps; see the field description.
        stop_on_error (bool): stop at the first failure (default true).
        dry_run (bool): check everything, run nothing.

    Returns:
        str: JSON: {
          "ran": int, "failed": int, "skipped": int, "dry_run": bool,
          "steps": [{"index", "tool", "label", "level", "ok",
                     "result": {...} | str, "skipped": bool}]
        }
        Each step's "result" is that tool's own answer, so handles from one
        step can be read out and used in the next call.

    Examples:
        - Use when: "set up sheet E-101 on A1 with our title block and the
          ground floor at 1:100" — four steps, one call.
        - Use when: "make this IFC a shop drawing" — remap the layers, tidy the
          overrides, flatten to zero, then check the standard.
        - Use when: the drawing must not be left half-changed if an argument is
          wrong.
        - Don't use when: you are drawing hundreds of entities
          (autocad_batch_draw is far faster), or you need a save, an export, a
          command or AutoLISP — those are refused here by design.

    Error Handling:
        - An unknown tool, a Publish or Admin step, a nested sequence, or
          arguments a tool would reject: all are reported with the step number
          before anything runs.
        - A step that fails while running is reported with its own error text;
          the steps after it are marked skipped unless stop_on_error=false.
