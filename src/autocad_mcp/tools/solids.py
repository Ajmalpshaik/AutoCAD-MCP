"""3D: solids, profiles turned into solids, booleans, and looking at the result.

What a modeller needs to go from a flat drawing to a model and back:

* **Primitives** - box, wedge, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus. A duct, a pad, a
  bollard, a tank.
* **A profile into a solid** - draw the section flat, then extrude it along Z
  or revolve it about an axis. Every real part starts this way.
* **Booleans** - union, subtract, intersect. A plate with holes in it is a box
  minus some cylinders.
* **Mass properties** - volume, centroid, bounding box. What a weight takes-off
  needs.
* **Looking at it** - a named 3D direction and a visual style, so the modeller
  (and ``autocad_preview``) can actually see the model.
* **3D paths** - a pipe route or a helix as one 3D polyline.

A note on where the geometry lands: AutoCAD's primitive calls place a solid by
the **centre of its bounding box**, with the base on the current XY plane. That
is not where a drafter expects a box to go, so these tools take the base centre
and work the rest out, and report both.

    plan plus 2D wireframe is back to normal drafting.

    This only changes what is on screen, so it needs no padlock — the same
    level as autocad_zoom. It does not move or change a single object.

    """Move, rotate, mirror or array in three dimensions.

    The ordinary modify tools work on the flat: they move in XY and rotate
    about Z. A model needs more — tip a brace about the X axis, mirror a
    handed assembly in a vertical plane, stack a floor layout up through a
    building. That is this.

    One undo step, however many objects.

    Args:
        handles (list[str]): what to transform.
        operation (str): move, rotate, mirror or array.
        displacement (Optional[list[float]]): move: [dx, dy, dz].
        axis_point / axis_direction (Optional[list[float]]): rotate: the axis.
        angle (Optional[float]): rotate: degrees.
        plane_point / plane_normal (Optional[list[float]]): mirror: the plane.
        keep_original (bool): mirror: keep the original too. Default true.
        levels (Optional[int]): array: how many in total.
        level_spacing (Optional[float]): array: the rise between them.
        coords (str): 'world' or 'ucs'.

    Returns:
        str: JSON: {"operation", "count": int, "handles": [str],
             "new_handles": [str], "failed": [{"handle", "reason"}]}

    Examples:
        - Use when: "lift that whole frame 3500 up" — move,
          displacement=[0, 0, 3500].
        - Use when: "tip that brace 30 degrees about the X axis" — rotate,
          axis_point, axis_direction=[1,0,0], angle=30.
        - Use when: "mirror this handed bracket about the horizontal plane at
          2000" — mirror, plane_point=[0,0,2000], plane_normal=[0,0,1].
        - Use when: "copy this floor up 12 times at 3600" — array, levels=13,
          level_spacing=3600.
        - Don't use when: everything stays flat — autocad_move_entities,
          autocad_rotate_entities and autocad_mirror_entities are simpler and
          read better for 2D work.
