"""Super hatch: a block repeated as a hatch inside a closed outline (D-40).

Express Tools' SUPERHATCH has no COM call, so the Heron plug-in builds it:
a new block holding the grid of tiles, inserted once and clipped to the
outline the way XCLIP clips. One object to move, erase or Ctrl+Z.

    """Fill a closed outline with a block repeated like a hatch (Express Tools' SUPERHATCH).

    Paving, cladding panels, a tiled ceiling, a grating: any block, laid in a
    grid from an origin, turned to an angle, and clipped to the outline the
    way XCLIP clips. The result is one block reference: move, copy or erase it
    as one, and one Ctrl+Z takes it away. The tiles sit on layer 0, ByBlock,
    so the reference's layer and colour are what shows.

    One undo step.

    Args:
        boundary (str): the closed outline, flat in plan.
        block (str): the block to repeat.
        spacing (Optional[list[float]]): [along, across].
        origin (Optional[list[float]]): where the grid is set out from.
        angle (float): degrees counter-clockwise.
        scale (float): tile size against the block as drawn.
        name (Optional[str]): name of the block that holds the tiles.
        layer (Optional[str]): layer for the result, created if missing.
        color (Optional[str|int]): its colour.
        coords (str): 'world' or 'ucs' for origin and angle.

    Returns:
        str: JSON: {"created": true, "handle": str, "block": str, "tile": str,
             "tiles": int, "spacing": [float, float], "boundary": str,
             "verified": bool}

    Examples:
        - Use when: "fill the terrace outline with the 600 x 300 paver block"
          — boundary, block='PAVER'.
        - Use when: "super hatch the ceiling with the 600 tile set out from
          the room centre" — origin at the centre.
        - Use when: "lay the grating panels at 45 degrees in this pit".
        - Don't use when: a normal hatch pattern does it - autocad_add_hatch,
          or make the pattern with autocad_create_hatch_pattern.

    Error Handling:
        - An open, tilted or non-curve outline is refused before anything is
          made.
        - A block that is not in the drawing points at autocad_list_blocks.
        - More than 10,000 tiles is refused: make the spacing or scale bigger.
