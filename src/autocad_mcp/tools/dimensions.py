"""Dimensioning a run of features, and the centre marks that go with it.

``autocad_add_dimension`` does one dimension at a time, which is right for one
dimension. A real drawing wants a *run*: eight dimensions along a wall, all on
one line, all at the same offset, in order, with an overall above them. Done one
call at a time that is eight calls and eight chances for the offset to drift.

So ``autocad_dimension_run`` takes the feature points and lays the whole run
out: a chain (AutoCAD's Continue), a baseline set stacked clear of each other,
an overall, or ordinates from a datum. The arithmetic - sorting the points,
working out each dimension line's offset, placing the text - is plain functions
at the top of this file and tested without AutoCAD.

``autocad_add_centre_marks`` adds the cross a drawing office expects on every
circle and arc. There is no Automation call for one, so they are drawn as
lines, which also means they come out on whatever layer you ask for.

        - Use when: "dimension every hole back to the left edge" —

    """Put a centre mark on every circle and arc: the cross a drawing office expects.

    Give the handles, or a layer and every circle and arc on it is marked.
    ``extend`` turns the cross into full centre lines running past the circle.

    AutoCAD has no Automation call for a centre mark, so these are drawn as
    lines — which means they go on the layer you ask for and plot the way that
    layer does. One undo step.

    Args:
        handles (Optional[list[str]]): the circles and arcs to mark.
        layer_filter (Optional[str]): or every circle and arc on this layer.
        size (Optional[float]): half length of the cross.
        extend (float): how far centre lines run past the circle.
        layer (Optional[str]): layer for the marks, created if missing.
        color (Optional[str | int]): colour for the marks.
        min_radius (float): skip anything smaller than this.
        dry_run (bool): report only.

    Returns:
        str: JSON: {"marked": int, "skipped": int, "created", "handles",
             "circles": [{"handle", "centre", "radius"}]}

    Examples:
        - Use when: "put centre lines on all the holes" — layer_filter the hole
          layer, extend about 2 mm of paper.
        - Use when: a fabricator asks for hole centres to be marked.
        - Don't use when: you want a radius or diameter dimension
          (autocad_add_dimension).

        - A handle that is not a circle or an arc is counted in "skipped" and
