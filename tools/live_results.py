"""Writing live-check results back into the NEEDS-CHECKING register.

Kept apart from the runner for one reason: this is the part that edits a
hand-maintained file, so it is a set of pure string functions with tests behind
them. The runner that drives AutoCAD cannot be tested without AutoCAD; this
can, and it is the half that could do damage.

A register row looks like:

    | E4 | Do the thing | Pass looks like | NOT RUN |

Only the **last** cell is ever touched, matched by the row id in the first
cell. Everything else on the line - the prose, the bold, the links - is left
exactly as it was.
