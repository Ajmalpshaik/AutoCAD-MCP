# tools - scripts you run by hand

| Script | Needs AutoCAD | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `build_plugin.py` | No (needs the .NET SDK) | Builds the plug-in for all three AutoCAD ranges into `dist/HeronAutoCAD.bundle` |
| `install_plugin.py` | **Closed** | Copies the bundle into `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins`; `--uninstall` removes it |
| `check_structure.py` | No | Repository rules (AutoCAD API only in the add-in, every tool has a level, doc links). Runs in CI |
| `smoke_test.py` | Yes, with a drawing open | Live checks against a scratch drawing, then cleans up |
| `protocol_check.py` | Yes | Starts the server as Claude does and does the MCP handshake over stdio |

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/build_plugin.py
```

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/install_plugin.py
```

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/check_structure.py
```

The live scripts expect the server at `.venv\Scripts\autocad-mcp.exe`. With the plug-in installed,
press **Heron** in AutoCAD first (and turn on Changes for the smoke test), or run them against a
server started with `--no-bridge`.
