# Heron AI for AutoCAD - Documentation index

> **Status, 2026-10-26:** the server (tools gated by the Heron plug-in) passes its offline tests;
> the plug-in builds for AutoCAD 2021-2027 and its bridge passes its offline tests, including the
> real Python client against the real C# server. **The plug-in has not yet run inside a real
> AutoCAD**: every live row in [NEEDS-CHECKING](NEEDS-CHECKING.md) is NOT RUN. Where work stopped:
> [HANDOVER](HANDOVER.md).
>
> Counts typed on these pages go stale. Derive them: `.venv\Scripts\autocad-mcp.exe --list-tools`
> for tools, `pytest --collect-only -q` and `dotnet test --list-tests` for tests.
