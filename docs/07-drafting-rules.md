# 07 - Drafting rules

Ajmal's drafting standard, built into Heron so **every AI that connects follows it**: the short form
is in the server's instructions (`core/registry.py`), the full checklist is the `draw_detail` prompt
(`tools/resources.py`). Decision: [D-25](DECISIONS.md).

## The rules

| # | Rule | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Units first.** Check the drawing before drawing in it. Draw in the open drawing unless asked for a new one | `autocad_status` (the gate refuses changes until it has run, [D-19](DECISIONS.md)) |
| 2 | **Parts are blocks.** Every fitting, elbow, valve, clamp, plate, anchor, support piece and item of equipment is a named block. Pipes, ducts and runs may stay lines | `autocad_make_block`, `autocad_insert_block`, `autocad_mirror_entities` |
| 3 | **Labels are real leaders.** TLD style (MTEXT, leader ending under the text, L or angled) or a multileader. Never a line plus a text | `autocad_add_label` |
| 4 | **Labels in a tidy column**: evenly spaced, same order as the parts, short leaders, none crossing | `autocad_add_label` with `text_align` |
| 5 | **Dimensions grouped**, whole numbers, DIMSCALE set to the drawing scale | `autocad_add_dimension` (`text_override`) |
| 6 | **Views aligned**: plan under the elevation on the same centre line; underlined titles with a smaller scale line; notes aligned to the top | `autocad_add_mtext` |
| 7 | **Layers per discipline**; text height = paper height x scale (2.5 mm at 1:10 = 25) | `autocad_create_layer` |
| 8 | **Look before reporting**: preview, fix overlaps and crossings, preview again | `autocad_preview` |

## The sheet rules

Added with the sheet tools ([09](09-sheets-and-coordinates.md), [D-27](DECISIONS.md)). They are the
same standard carried through to the issued drawing.

| # | Rule | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | **Know the coordinate system before drawing.** A moved or turned UCS means the modeller's numbers are not world numbers | `autocad_status` reports it; `autocad_get_ucs`, `autocad_convert_points`, `coords="ucs"` on `autocad_batch_draw` |
| 10 | **A real scale on every viewport**, never "near enough", and **locked** so the next zoom cannot change it | `autocad_add_viewport` (locked by default) |
| 11 | **A rotated plan reads upright on the sheet** | `autocad_add_viewport(align_to_ucs=true)` or `twist` |
| 12 | **Title block in the corner** of every sheet, frame to ISO 5457 (20 mm binding edge, 10 elsewhere), attributes filled | `autocad_place_title_block(all_layouts=true, per_layout_attributes=...)` |
| 13 | **One location, named once**, then plotted, viewported and measured from | `autocad_save_view`, then `view_name` on `autocad_add_viewport` and `area="view"` on `autocad_export` |
| 14 | **Set the drawing up before drawing in it**: units, scale, snaps. The scale sets DIMSCALE, LTSCALE and the annotation scale together | `autocad_drawing_setup` |
| 15 | **An import is not a drawing.** Layers first, then clear the per-object overrides, then flatten, then check the standard | `autocad_remap_layers`, `autocad_tidy_entities`, `autocad_check_standards` |

## The geometry and annotation rules

Added with the shape, dimension and 3D tools ([10](10-geometry-annotation-3d.md),
[D-30](DECISIONS.md)).

| # | Rule | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | **A named shape is never drawn by hand.** A slot, a flange, a stair, a reducer's flat pattern: ask for the shape, do not build it from lines | `autocad_make_shape` (24 shapes) |
| 17 | **An arc stays part of its object.** A slot, a rounded corner, an elbow is one polyline with bulges, never a pile of loose arcs | `bulges` on `autocad_batch_draw`; every shape already does it |
| 18 | **Dimension the run, not the dimension.** A chain on one line at one offset, in order, with the overall above it | `autocad_dimension_run` |
| 19 | **Centre marks on every circle.** A fabricator needs the hole centres | `autocad_add_centre_marks` |
| 20 | **One note, one multileader** — however many things it points at | `autocad_add_multileader` |
| 21 | **A schedule is a table**, not a grid of loose text | `autocad_extract_attributes`, then `autocad_add_table` |
| 22 | **Model the part, then take the numbers off it.** Draw the section, extrude or revolve it, boolean the holes out, read the volume | `autocad_extrude_profile`, `autocad_solid_boolean`, `autocad_solid_properties` |
| 23 | **Look at a 3D model before saying it is done**: a south-west isometric in the hidden style, then preview | `autocad_set_3d_view`, `autocad_preview` |

## Where it came from

The live session of 2026-10-26: a roof pipe-support detail drawn first as loose lines with long,
sloping labels, then redrawn to these rules (18 named blocks, one label column, plan under the
elevation). Ajmal's words: *"think like a senior draftsman ... the text arrangement should be very
neat and clean"*; *"elbows and everything should be blocks"*; labels *"L shaped, and angled if
needed ... multileader also"* ([D-24](DECISIONS.md)).
