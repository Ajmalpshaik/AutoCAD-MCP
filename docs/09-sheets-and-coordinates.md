# 09 - Sheets, coordinates and shop drawings

The three things a draftsman does that a drawing tool on its own cannot: **work in the coordinate
system the modeller set**, **lay a sheet out**, and **turn somebody else's model into an issued
drawing**. Decisions: [D-27](DECISIONS.md), [D-28](DECISIONS.md), [D-29](DECISIONS.md).

## 1. The UCS: why a line lands in the wrong place

Every coordinate AutoCAD's Automation API takes or returns is a **World** coordinate. The modeller
does not work there. They set a UCS — moved to a grid intersection, turned onto a wall, tilted onto
a sloping roof — and from then on every number they read off the screen is in that system.

So "draw a line from 0,0 to 5000,0" means two different lines, and the drawing gives no hint which
one was used.

| Tool | Level | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| `autocad_get_ucs` | Read | Is a UCS set? Moved, turned how many degrees, tilted, flipped? What is saved in the drawing? |
| `autocad_set_ucs` | Change | Set it: back to `world`, onto a saved one, to an `origin` and angle, from `3point`, aligned to an `entity`, or flat on the `view`. `save_as` keeps it under a name |
| `autocad_convert_points` | Read | AutoLISP's `trans`: points (and angles) between the UCS and the world, changing nothing |

**Nothing draws blind.** `autocad_status` now reports the UCS on every drawing, and adds a
`ucs_advice` sentence when it is not the world one. The gate already forces `autocad_status` before
any change ([D-19](DECISIONS.md)), so the warning arrives before the first line.

**Drawing in the UCS.** `autocad_batch_draw` takes `coords="ucs"`: every point is converted and
every angle picks up the UCS rotation before a single expression is sent, so a rectangle square to
a turned grid comes out turned. The arithmetic is in
[`acad/coords.py`](../src/autocad_mcp/acad/coords.py), built from `UCSORG`, `UCSXDIR` and `UCSYDIR`,
and tested without AutoCAD.

The single-entity `autocad_draw_*` tools still take world coordinates only; convert first with
`autocad_convert_points`, or draw through `autocad_batch_draw` ([ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)).

**A tilted UCS is refused, not guessed.** On a UCS tilted out of the world XY plane a flat `[x, y]`
has no single world answer and an on-screen angle is not a world angle, so `coords="ucs"` says so
and points you at `autocad_convert_points`, which gives all three numbers.

## 2. One location, used everywhere

You window a region to plot it. Then you want a viewport on that region. Then a detail bubble on it.
Each time the two corners come out slightly different.

A **named view** is AutoCAD's own answer, and here it is a location you name once:

```
autocad_save_view(name="DETAIL-A", corner1=[...], corner2=[...])   # or handles=[...] + pad
autocad_export(path="...pdf", area="view", view_name="DETAIL-A")   # plot that exact area
autocad_add_viewport(view_name="DETAIL-A", scale="1:20")           # a viewport on that exact area
autocad_list_views()                                              # read the corners back
```

| Tool | Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `autocad_save_view` | Change | From two corners, or from the objects' own extents with `pad`. `coords="ucs"` converts the window first. `zoom_to` shows it |
| `autocad_list_views` | Read | Every saved view with its centre, size and **both corners** |
| `autocad_export` | Publish | `area` is now `extents` (default), `layout`, `limits`, `display`, `window` or `view`, with `scale` |

---

## 3. Laying out a sheet

| Tool | Level | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `autocad_create_layout` | Change | The sheet: layout, paper size, orientation, plotter, plot style table. Optionally copied from an existing layout. Returns the sheet's arithmetic — frame, drawing space, where the title block goes |
| `autocad_page_setup` | Change | AutoCAD's Page Setup on one sheet or `all_layouts`: plotter, paper, plot area, scale, `monochrome.ctb`, lineweights. Only what you pass is written |
| `autocad_place_title_block` | Change | The title block in the corner of one sheet or every sheet, with its attributes filled — including `per_layout_attributes` for sheet numbers |
| `autocad_add_viewport` | Change | A viewport at a real scale, looking where you say, twisted if the plan is on a slant, and locked |

### What makes the scale right

The model window handed to AutoCAD is worked out to the viewport's **own proportions**
([`acad/sheets.py`](../src/autocad_mcp/acad/sheets.py)): 180 x 120 mm of paper at 1:50 is exactly
9000 x 6000 drawing units. Nothing is added to make it fit, so 1:50 comes out 1:50. The scale is
then pinned with the viewport's `CustomScale`, because a zoom to a window can only ever land near a
round number.

Leave `scale` out and the **largest standard scale that fits** is chosen and reported — what a
draftsman does when the sheet size is fixed.

### A rotated plan on an upright sheet

`twist` turns the view inside the viewport. `align_to_ucs=true` takes the angle from the drawing's
current UCS, so a wing set up on a 23 degree grid reads square on the sheet. The area AutoCAD is
told to fit is the upright box around the turned one, so nothing falls outside the frame.

### Viewports lock by default

`locked=true` is the default. An unlocked viewport gets scrolled by the next person who zooms inside
it, and the scale printed on the title block stops being true. The lock is set **after** the view is
aimed, because AutoCAD refuses the zoom otherwise.

### Where the sheet's corners are

Paper-space `(0, 0)` is treated as the lower-left of the **printable area**, which is where AutoCAD
puts it for a layout plotted from its own origin. `anchor="paper"` measures from the sheet edge
instead. The frame defaults to **ISO 5457**: 20 mm on the binding (left) edge, 10 mm on the other
three, title block bottom-right. Every tool reports the rectangle it used, and `autocad_preview`
shows the result.

The paper size comes from the layout's own `GetPaperSize`; when a plotter is not configured it is read
out of the canonical media name, which carries the dimensions
(`ISO_full_bleed_A3_(420.00_x_297.00_MM)`).

## 4. Drawing settings, and styles

| Tool | Level | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `autocad_drawing_setup` | Change | Units, precision, the drawing scale and everything that follows from it, object snaps, point style, linetype scaling, limits. `dry_run` shows the plan |
| `autocad_create_styles` | Change | Text styles and dimension styles with real values |

Give the scale once — `scale="1:50"` — and `DIMSCALE`, the annotation scale and `LTSCALE` follow.
`paper_text_height=2.5` with it sets `TEXTSIZE` to the model height (125 at 1:50).

**Why these are Change and not Admin.** `autocad_set_variable` is Admin because it will set *any*
system variable, which is an escape hatch. These two write only from a fixed list kept in
[`tools/settings.py`](../src/autocad_mcp/tools/settings.py) — drafting settings, and the `DIM`
variables behind a dimension style. They cannot save a file, run a command, or reach outside that
list ([D-28](DECISIONS.md)). Every call reports the old value beside the new one.

A dimension style is built the way AutoCAD's API requires: the `DIM` variables are set, the style is
added, the style copies them off the document, and the drawing's own variables are **put back**.
Multileader styles have no Automation API; make one in AutoCAD, or bring it in with
`autocad_import_from_drawing`.

## 5. An IFC or Revit export into a shop drawing

An export lands as geometry, not as a drawing: layers called `IfcWallStandardCase` or nothing but
layer 0; colour, linetype and lineweight set on every single object, so changing a layer appears to
do nothing; a real Z on work that should be flat, so trim and hatch misbehave.

| Tool | Level | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `autocad_remap_layers` | Change | Puts everything on the right layer, and makes those layers with the colour, linetype, lineweight, description and plot setting they should have |
| `autocad_tidy_entities` | Change | Clears the per-object overrides, flattens to one level, moves geometry off layer 0, deletes the zero-length leftovers |

**Both default to `dry_run=true`.** Read the counts and `by_rule`, agree them, then run again with
`dry_run=false`.

A rule matches on any of `name_like` (the object's layer **or** its block name — an exporter puts the
element type in one or the other and you rarely know which), `source_layer`, `block_name`,
`entity_type`, `source_color`, `text_contains`. Wildcards work, and `/regex/` between slashes. The
first matching rule wins, so rule order is part of the rules.

> `color` is the **target layer's** colour. To match an object's own colour use `source_color`. A
> rule with nothing to match on is refused, because it would sweep the whole drawing onto one layer.

`preset="ifc"` is a **starting point, not a standard**: it maps the usual IFC and Revit class words
onto AIA-style discipline layers (`A-WALL`, `M-HVAC-DUCT`, `E-CABL-TRAY`, `S-BEAM`...). For an
office standard pass `rules`, or `rules_path` to a JSON file, and prove the result with
`autocad_check_standards`.

```
autocad_remap_layers(preset="ifc", unmatched_layer="X-REVIEW")              # look
autocad_remap_layers(preset="ifc", unmatched_layer="X-REVIEW", dry_run=false, set_bylayer=true)
autocad_tidy_entities(flatten_z=0, off_layer_0="X-REVIEW", dry_run=false)
autocad_check_standards(rules={"require_bylayer_color": true, "forbid_entities_on_layer_0": true})
```

## 6. `autocad_sequence`: AutoLISP's `progn`

Setting up a sheet is five calls that only make sense together. `autocad_sequence` takes the list,
**checks every step's arguments against that tool's own schema before the first one runs**, and
reports each step's own answer.

```
autocad_sequence(steps=[
  {"tool": "autocad_create_layout",     "args": {"name": "E-101", "paper_size": "A1"}},
  {"tool": "autocad_place_title_block", "args": {"block": "TTLB-A1", "attributes": {"DWG_NO": "E-101"}}},
  {"tool": "autocad_add_viewport",      "args": {"view_name": "GROUND-FLOOR", "scale": "1:100"}},
])
```

**It cannot raise what you are allowed to do.** The sequence is a Change tool, and it refuses any
step at the Publish or Admin level, and a sequence inside a sequence ([D-29](DECISIONS.md)). So it
can draw, modify and delete exactly as the **Changes** padlock already allows, and it can never save
a file, plot, run a command or evaluate AutoLISP along the way.

Each step keeps its own undo step, so Ctrl+Z backs them out one at a time. With **Ask to Keep** on,
Discard backs out the whole call.

For hundreds of entities use `autocad_batch_draw` instead — it is far faster.

## 7. A whole sheet, start to finish

```
autocad_status()                                              # units, and the UCS
autocad_drawing_setup(units="millimeters", scale="1:100", paper_text_height=2.5)
autocad_save_view(name="GROUND-FLOOR", handles=[...], pad=500)
autocad_sequence(steps=[
  {"tool": "autocad_create_layout",     "args": {"name": "A-101", "paper_size": "A1",
                                                 "plot_style_table": "monochrome.ctb",
                                                 "title_block_width": 180}},
  {"tool": "autocad_place_title_block", "args": {"block": "TTLB-A1", "layer": "G-TTLB",
                                                 "attributes": {"DWG_NO": "A-101", "SCALE": "1:100"}}},
  {"tool": "autocad_add_viewport",      "args": {"view_name": "GROUND-FLOOR", "scale": "1:100",
                                                 "title_block_width": 180, "gap": 2,
                                                 "layer": "G-VPRT"}},
])
autocad_preview()                                             # look before saying it is done
autocad_export(path="...A-101.pdf", area="layout", scale="1:1", paper_size="A1")
```
